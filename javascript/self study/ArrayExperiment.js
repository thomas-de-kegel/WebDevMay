//Practice hungarian notation:
// write in lowerCamelCase, with the lower letter indicating the type of variable it's supposed to be (oMember for an object called member, sName for a string, bPassed for a boolean etc)

// For comment blocks use a //* and // /* at the end, as removing the first slash will toggle the visibility of the entire block
